# ERC

This Solidity program implements an ERC20 token contract named "Prism" (PSM). The contract provides basic functionalities such as minting tokens, burning tokens, and managing ownership using the Ownable pattern from OpenZeppelin.

The contract is written in Solidity, a language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The ERC20 standard outlines a set of rules for Ethereum tokens, facilitating token transfers between addresses and enabling interoperability with other decentralized applications.

# Executing the Program

To deploy and interact with this ERC20 token contract, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. Follow these steps:

1. Access Remix:
Visit the Remix website at Remix Ethereum.

2. Create a New File:
Click on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar of Remix to create a new file. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., ERCToken.sol).

3. Copy and paste the following Solidity code into the file in Remix

4. Compile the Code:
- Click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in Remix, ensure the compiler version is compatible (e.g., 0.8.24), and click "Compile ERCToken.sol".
Deploy the Contract:

- After compilation, switch to the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in Remix. Select the ERCToken contract from the dropdown menu and deploy it.
Once deployed, you can mint, burn, and transfer tokens.
